      <description>&lt;p&gt;some people might ask, “why?” - and i say - &amp;ldquo;because why not&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i&amp;rsquo;ve done lots of various things within the open source community, albeit things that aren&amp;rsquo;t always surfaced and visible to most. i like to ponder about technology and its impact on ourselves and the planet, from its largest scales down to the miniscule. i have chosen to open source nearly all of the personal development projects that i&amp;rsquo;ve worked on throughtout my life, and applying the same principle, i thought it a neat idea and sometimes topic of discussion to take the data generated by submitting an at-home dna test for analysis and releasing that data to the public and wider world, for free - open sourcing a bit of myself in a sense. as this blurb of writing in january 2025 stands, i have only come across two others who have chosen to do this same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
